        <h3>Fact #1</h3>
        <p>Lebron James is the greatest basketball player of all time. LeBron James is known for his exceptional versatility and longevity in the NBA. He has consistently performed at an elite level across multiple basketball positions and has been a dominant force in the league since his debut in 2003. This has allowed him to accumulate impressive career stats, including being the only player in NBA history to rank in the top ten for both all-time points and assists. His ability to adapt and excel in various roles on the court over such an extended period is a testament to his unique skill set and physical prowess. </p>
