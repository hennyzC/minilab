            <h2>Accessibility Basics</h2>
            <p>Begin by structuring your HTML to support accessibility. Use semantic elements to describe the purpose of content clearly. Implement ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles to enhance user experience for assistive technologies. Test your site for keyboard-only navigation to ensure all interactive elements are accessible.</p>
