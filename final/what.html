            <h1>What is Universal Design</h1>
            <p>Universal design is the process of creating products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.</p>

            <h2>Core Principles of Universal Design</h2>
            <p>Universal design is guided by seven core principles that ensure maximum usability and accessibility for individuals of all abilities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equitable Use:</strong> Design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility in Use:</strong> Design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple and Intuitive:</strong> Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of user’s experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</li>
                <li><strong>Perceptible Information:</strong> Design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Tolerance for Error:</strong> Design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Physical Effort:</strong> Design can be used efficiently and comfortably with a minimum of fatigue.</li>
                <li><strong>Size and Space for Approach and Use:</strong> Appropriate size and space are provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use, regardless of user’s body size, posture, or mobility.</li>
