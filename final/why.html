            <h2>Benefits for All Users</h2>
            <p>Universal design benefits everyone, not just those with disabilities. Features like clear navigation, readable fonts, and responsive design enhance the overall user experience, making web content more enjoyable and efficient for all users. I've noticed sometimes a simple design is better to target an audience rather than a bunch of information at once as shown below</p>
